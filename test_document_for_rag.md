# RAG System Test Document

## AWS Cloud Services Overview

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive cloud computing platform that provides a wide variety of infrastructure services. AWS offers computing power, storage solutions, and networking capabilities on a pay-as-you-go basis.

### Key AWS Services

1. **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: Virtual servers in the cloud that provide scalable computing capacity. EC2 instances can be configured with various operating systems and hardware specifications.

2. **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Object storage service designed to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere. S3 provides 99.999999999% (11 9's) durability.

3. **Amazon Lambda**: Serverless compute service that runs code in response to events without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda automatically scales applications by running code in response to triggers.

4. **Amazon Bedrock**: Fully managed service that offers foundation models from leading AI companies through a single API. Bedrock enables building generative AI applications.

### Vector Databases and RAG

**Zilliz/Milvus** is a cloud-native vector database designed for storing, indexing, and managing massive embedding vectors generated by machine learning models. It is optimized for similarity search and AI applications.

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** combines the power of retrieval systems with large language models. RAG systems:
- First retrieve relevant documents from a knowledge base
- Then use these documents as context for generating responses
- Provide more accurate and contextual answers
- Reduce hallucinations in AI responses

### Benefits of RAG Systems

1. **Improved Accuracy**: By grounding responses in actual documents, RAG systems provide more reliable information.
2. **Dynamic Knowledge**: The knowledge base can be updated without retraining the model.
3. **Source Attribution**: Responses can include references to source documents.
4. **Domain Specificity**: RAG systems can be specialized for specific domains by curating relevant documents.

### Testing Guidelines

When testing a RAG system, consider these key aspects:
- Document ingestion and processing speed
- Vector embedding quality and retrieval accuracy
- Response generation latency
- Source attribution correctness
- System scalability under load
